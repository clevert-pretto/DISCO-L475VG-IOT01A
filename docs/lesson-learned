# Module 01 & 02: The Bare-Metal Foundation

* **Reference Manual:** RM0351 (STM32L4x5).

* **Registers:** RCC_AHB2ENR (0x4002104C), GPIOB_MODER (0x48000400), USART1_BRR (`0x4001380C`).

* **Logic:** Manual calculation of Baud Rate divisors and bit-masking for GPIO Alternative Functions (`AF7 for UART`).

* **Hurdles:** Initial attempts failed because the peripheral clock gating was not enabled before configuring registers.

* **Lesson:** Always enable the clock in RCC before touching peripheral registers, or the writes will be ignored by the silicon.

# Module 03 & 04: Precision Timing & HTS221 Sensing

* **Reference Manual:** RM0351 & Cortex-M4 Programming Manual.

* **Registers:** SYSTICK_LOAD (`0xE000E014`), CPACR (`0xE000ED88`), I2C2_TIMINGR (`0x40005810`).

* **Logic:** Implemented linear interpolation using factory-stored calibration coefficients.

* **Hurdles:** The system hung immediately upon performing float math because the hardware Floating Point Unit (FPU) is disabled by default.

* **Lesson:** Enabling the FPU requires a specific "Coprocessor Access" sequence in the Reset_Handler. Additionally, I learned to use HSI16 (`16MHz`) as a stable clock source for I2C timing to ensure a consistent `100kHz` bus speed.

# Module 05: DMA Acceleration & Interrupts
* **Reference Manual:** RM0351 (DMA & NVIC Sections).

* **Registers:** DMA1_CSELR (`0x400200A8`), DMA1_IFCR (`0x40020004`), NVIC_ISER0 (`0xE000E100`).

* **Logic:** Configured DMA1 Channel 4 to offload UART transmissions from the CPU.

* **Hurdles:** The "One-Shot" bug—DMA would only send data once. I discovered that simply enabling the channel isn't enough; the hardware requires a manual flag clear.

* **Lesson:** The Transfer Complete (TC) flag in IFCR must be cleared via a direct assignment (=), not a bitwise OR (|=), because IFCR is a write-only register. This "hard reset" of the channel is essential for continuous data streams.

# Module 06: System Reliability (IWDG)
* **Reference Manual:** RM0351 (Independent Watchdog) Section 32.

* **Registers:** IWDG_KR (Key), IWDG_PR (Prescaler), IWDG_RLR (Reload).

* **Logic:** Implemented a fail-safe timer that resets the CPU if the main loop hangs for more than 2 seconds.

* **Hurdles:** Understanding that the IWDG runs on the LSI (`32kHz`) clock, which is independent of the main HSI16 clock, providing a true secondary safety layer. 
* Ensuring the watchdog timeout was long enough to accommodate the I2C sensor read and DMA telemetry duration, but short enough to prevent system damage in a real failure.

* **Lesson:** Security through isolation. By running on the LSI, the watchdog can rescue the system even if the main oscillator fails or the PLL loses lock.

### **Module 07: SPI & The Silent Bluetooth Chip**
* **Reference Manual**: RM0351 Section 38.
* **The Register Trap (MODER)**: Identified that using a pin-number constant (like 10) in a 2-bit `MODER` field causes a "bit spill," corrupting the settings of adjacent pins. Mode values must strictly be `0-3`.
* **The Deadlock Trap**: I encountered a "silent hang" where the UART printed the header but nothing else. I traced this to a `while(!(SR & TXE))` loop. This happens if the peripheral clock is not enabled; the register returns `0`, causing an infinite wait.
* **The BSY Flag Logic**: I learned that `TXE` (Transmit Empty) only means the FIFO has room. To safely raise the Chip Select (CS) line without truncating the last bit, I must wait for the `BSY` (Busy) flag to clear.

### **Module 08: Interrupt Pipeline & Diagnostic Baselines** 
* **Reference Manual:** RM0351 (EXTI & SYSCFG Sections).
* **Registers:** SYSCFG_EXTICR4 (`0x40010014`), EXTI_IMR1 (`0x40010400`), NVIC_ISER1 (`0xE000E104`).

* **Logic:** Established a **Known-Good Baseline** using the User Button (PC13) to isolate the MCU's interrupt pipeline from other tasks.
    * **ISER Banking:** Learned that IRQ 40 (EXTI15_10) requires `NVIC_ISER1` as `ISER0` only covers IRQs 0-31.
* **Lesson:** **Peripheral Boundary Accuracy.** `SYSCFG` and `EXTI` are adjacent but distinct peripherals. Correcting the base address to `0x40010400UL` was the "Final Boss" of the interrupt diagnostic.
* **Lesson:** **VTOR Stability.** Manually setting the **Vector Table Offset Register (VTOR)** to `0x08000000` ensures the CPU locates the ISR jump-table even if the bootloader offset changes.
